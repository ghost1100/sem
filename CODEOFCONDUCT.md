1.	Public Interest: Software engineers must prioritize the public's safety, welfare, and privacy in their work. They should ensure their software is dependable, meets safety standards, and minimizes harm. They must disclose risks, avoid deception, and consider how their work affects all individuals, including those with disabilities or economic disadvantages.
2.	Client and Employer: Engineers must act in the best interest of their clients and employers, but never at the expense of the public interest. They must provide honest and competent service, respect confidentiality, and avoid using illegal or unethical software. If a project is likely to fail or encounter legal issues, they should promptly report it.
3.	Product: Engineers are responsible for ensuring the quality of the software they develop. They must strive to meet high professional standards, deliver realistic goals, and ensure adequate testing and documentation. They should also consider legal, cultural, and environmental impacts, and ensure privacy is respected.
4.	Judgment: Integrity and independence are key in professional decision-making. Engineers should base technical judgments on human values and not compromise their objectivity. They must avoid conflicts of interest, refuse unethical financial practices, and disclose unavoidable conflicts.
5.	Management: Software engineering managers and leaders must promote ethical practices in managing projects. This includes ensuring fair work assignments, protecting confidential information, offering fair remuneration, and making sure employees are aware of company standards and professional expectations.
6.	Profession: Engineers must uphold the reputation and integrity of the profession. They should help create an environment that supports ethical behaviour, contribute to public knowledge, report violations of the Code, and avoid associations that conflict with the profession's ethical standards.
7.	Colleagues: Engineers should support and respect their colleagues. This includes encouraging ethical behaviour, offering constructive feedback, sharing knowledge, giving credit where due, and ensuring fair treatment. They should intervene in a colleagueâ€™s work only in good faith, if necessary for public interest or employer concerns.
8.	Self: Lifelong learning is essential. Engineers must continuously improve their skills and knowledge, stay updated on legal and professional standards, and promote an ethical approach to their work. They must also avoid actions that would violate the Code and resist encouraging others to do so.
