Our Current Process
This is our current workflow. This is an important set of steps so document them:

Pull the latest develop branch.
Start a new feature branch.
Once feature is finished, create JAR file.
Update and test Docker configuration with GitHub Actions.
Update feature branch with develop to ensure feature is up-to-date.
Check feature branch still works.
Merge feature branch into develop.
Repeat 2-7 until release is ready.
Merge develop branch into release and create release.
Merge release into master and develop.
